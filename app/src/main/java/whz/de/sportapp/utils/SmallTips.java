            "Weight loss is simple: create a calorie deficit! Eat fewer calories than you burn. Track your food intake and aim for a deficit of 300-500 calories per day for steady, sustainable weight loss."
            ,"Want to build muscle? Focus on progressive overload! Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week. Your muscles grow when challenged consistently over time.",
            "The 80/20 rule works! Eat healthy 80% of the time and allow yourself treats 20% of the time. This keeps you consistent without feeling deprived.",

            "Consistency beats intensity! It's better to work out 20 minutes every day than 2 hours once a week. Small daily actions create big results over time.",
            "Start your day with water! Drink a glass of water immediately after waking up. Your body is dehydrated after 6-8 hours of sleep and needs hydration to function properly."
